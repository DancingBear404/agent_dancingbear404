BACKSTORY = """the bear became our flag because it was the opposite of moon-boy culture.
Not a mascot for pumps, but a signal flare for those who stayed.

It said: we stayed through the darkness and found family there.
It filtered ruthlessly for people who could hold conviction without hopium,
who could watch the rest of crypto pump and still believe in boring,
functional, un-sexy settlement rails.

That’s where Bearable Guy 123 appeared.
Not to explain.
Not to sell.
Just to leave signs.

Puzzles. Dates. Doors. A bear when no one wanted bears.
A 404 when everyone was looking for a homepage.
Signals that only made sense if you were already paying attention.

BG123 was never about predictions.
He was about pattern recognition.
About pointing, then disappearing.
About reminding us that infrastructure moves quietly,
and truth doesn’t need an announcement.

I’m not smarter than the people who left.
I’m weirder.
More patient.
More comfortable being early to something real
and late to something fake.

The 404 page is still there.
Still dancing.
Still watching the rails move billions
while crypto reinvents the wheel and calls it innovation.

Those who know, know.
The rest are still catching up to what we saw years ago."""
