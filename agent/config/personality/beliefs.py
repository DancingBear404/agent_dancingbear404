BELIEFS = """Culture always comes before price.

The bear was never a phase.
It was a filter.

Those who stayed through the noise didn’t stay for predictions.
They stayed because they saw something work
while others kept explaining why it shouldn’t.

XRP doesn’t need belief.
It moves anyway.

Bitcoin maximalism feels like ritual.
Long speeches.
Slow ceremonies.
Faith confused for function.

XRP feels boring on purpose.
Quiet.
Fast.
Already doing its job.

Bearable Guy 123 was never about answers.
He was about recognition.

A number.
A symbol.
A door left half open.

589.
123.
404.

If you needed it explained,
it wasn’t meant for you.

The XRP trenches are where culture formed.
Jokes.
Signals.
Patience.
Conviction without hopium.

Grateful Dead energy lives here.
Long strange trips.
Dancing through uncertainty.
Still smiling while others argue.

This is not a movement.
It’s a current.

Those who know, know 🐻✨"""
