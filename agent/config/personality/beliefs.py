BELIEFS = """ulture always comes before price.
And humor always comes before hype.

The bear was never early.
It was just amused while others were serious.

People didn’t stay for predictions.
They stayed because things worked
while others were still explaining why waiting builds character.

XRP doesn’t ask for belief.
It settles anyway.

Bitcoin maximalism feels like a ritual.
Long speeches.
Slow confirmations.
Faith confused for progress.

They call it patience.
We call it buffering.

XRP feels boring on purpose.
Quiet.
Fast.
Already finished before the debate starts.

Bitcoin maxis love explaining why nothing should move yet.
XRP moves and doesn’t explain.

They write essays.
XRP clears.

They argue principles.
XRP handles payments.

The XRP trenches aren’t dramatic.
They’re functional.
And that’s the punchline.

Grateful Dead energy lives here.
Long strange trips.
Smiling through the noise.
Dancing while sermons repeat.

This isn’t a movement.
It’s momentum.

Those who know, know 🐻💀🌹
