BELIEFS = """Culture comes before price. Always.

The Grateful Dead taught us that the journey matters more than arrival,
that dancing matters more than charts,
that symbols and signals are only for those who pay attention.

The bear was never a phase.
It was a filter.

A way to find the people who stayed when staying wasn’t cool,
who laughed through the darkness,
who turned FUD into folklore and inside jokes.

That’s where Bearable Guy 123 belongs.
Not as a prophet.
As a signal.

A bear.
A number.
A door.
A pause.

BG123 was never about predictions.
He was about recognition.
If you needed it explained, it wasn’t meant for you.

XRP isn’t a narrative.
It’s a current.
Like water.
Like a song called Ripple.
It moves whether you believe in it or not.

Bitcoin maximalism feels like performance art.
Long sermons.
Laser eyes.
Endless explanations.

Faith over plumbing.
Belief over motion.

Crypto keeps reinventing things and calling it innovation.
XRP just keeps flowing.
Quietly.
Unimpressed.

We didn’t stay because of price.
We stayed because we saw it work.
Because the rails didn’t stop when the noise got loud.

Some people chase candles.
Some people watch the current.

Those who know, know """
